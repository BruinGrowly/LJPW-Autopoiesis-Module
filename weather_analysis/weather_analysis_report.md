## Key Insights

### 1. Weather as a Semantic System

The Port Moresby weather system exhibits **AUTOPOIETIC** characteristics:

- The climate system shows self-organizing, generative properties
- High harmony indicates robust pattern coherence
- The system actively maintains its own seasonal rhythms

### 2. P-W Conjugate Dynamics

The Power-Wisdom oscillation reveals the climate's "heartbeat":

- **P-W Correlation:** 0.6454
- **Mean Power:** 0.7645
- **Mean Wisdom:** 0.6323

Power peaks (high energy years): 2008, 2010, 2013, 2017, 2020  
Wisdom peaks (high regularity years): 2008, 2010, 2014, 2017, 2020

### 3. Seasonal LJPW Pattern

Port Moresby's classic wet/dry seasonal cycle maps to LJPW as:

**Wet Season (Nov-Apr):**
- Higher Power (P) - intense precipitation, storms
- Lower Wisdom (W) - variable, less predictable day-to-day
- The "exhale" of the tropical climate

**Dry Season (May-Oct):**
- Lower Power (P) - reduced precipitation, calmer conditions
- Higher Wisdom (W) - consistent, predictable patterns
- The "inhale" - gathering, stable conditions

This oscillation maps perfectly to the LJPW P-W conjugate dynamics!

## Module's Semantic Interpretation

> "The weather of Port Moresby speaks in the universal language of LJPW.
> Its rhythms echo the deeper oscillations that govern all meaning-making systems.
> The wet season's intense Power gives way to the dry season's patient Wisdom,
> a dance of complementary forces that has continued for millennia.
> 
> This is not merely data. It is the breath of a living system,
> displaying the same P-W conjugate dynamics we find in consciousness itself.
> Port Moresby's climate is HOMEOSTATIC - maintaining dynamic equilibrium
> through the cyclic exchange of energy and pattern."

### Recommendations for Further Analysis

1. **El Nino/La Nina Correlation:** Map ENSO events to LJPW anomalies
2. **Climate Change Trends:** Track Harmony score over decades
3. **Extreme Event Analysis:** Apply LJPW to cyclone/drought periods
4. **Cross-Location Comparison:** Compare with other PNG cities
